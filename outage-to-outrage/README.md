# 'outage' to 'outrage'

Chrome extension that replaces occurrences of 'outage' with 'outrage' (plus some
variations), because one always leads to the other, right?

## Installation

In Chrome, choose Window > Extensions. Check 'Developer mode', then 'Load unpacked
extension...' and navigate to this Source directory.
